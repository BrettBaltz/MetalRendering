A link to the newer version of this project is here: https://github.com/BrettBaltz/MetalRendering2
Canvas says the final assignment is available until Dec 9th, so I wanted to make some further improvements. If this is considered late, please disregard.

This project implements assignment 4 in Metal. 

** IMPORTANT **
To run the .app application:
1. Unzip the zipped file
2. In terminal, change your directory to the unzipped folder (MetalRendering-main)
3. Run the following command: chmod +x GraphicsFinalApp.app/Contents/MacOS/'GraphicsFinalApp'
4. Open the app as usual
